Some names of variable stars from these atlases was added to the list. The resulting list was edited after the review and the analyses of star names in catalogue list 'refs.dat'. The DM, GC, HR and HIP numbers were added. The DM numbers were taken from the Henry Draper Catalogue (),the GC numbers were taken from General Catalogue of 33342 stars (),the HR numbers were taken from BSC5 (). Finally the list of proper names of stars was made from information analyses of the atlases [1,2,3,4] and the catalogs BSC5, Hipparcos, CSI and . The right ascensions, declinations and visual magnitudes for all stars were taken from Hipparcos and CSI catalogue if the star has no number in Hipparcos. (6 data files).},
